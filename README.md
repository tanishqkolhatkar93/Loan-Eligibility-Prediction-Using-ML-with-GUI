# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-Data-Science-Project

In this Project, we are creating a loan approval prediction system using Python and also it's **GUI** representation.

âœ… What is a loan prediction system? <br>
A mechanism called the Loan Prediction System allows you to apply for loans and receive notifications when they are approved. By the data provided by the applicant, the system notifies the applicant of the loan's availability. <br><br>

## Libraries

## Steps followed

- **Data Collection** - Completeness and correctness of data collection <br>
- **Data preparation** - cleansing and preparing data for the next steps of model development <br>
- **Algorithm Understanding** - Knowledge of the algorithm used for model development <br>
- **Model Development** - Building the model with the right selection of the parameters <br>
- **Model Tuning** - Improving the model performance by tuning the hyper parameters <br>
- **Model Evaluation** - Testing the model on sufficient sample for correctness <br>
  i)	Final Presentation and QA <br>
  ii)	Demonstration of the Working Demo of the system.
